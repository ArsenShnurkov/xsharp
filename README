XSharp - A subset of the Xlib C API wrapped for Mono in C#

This library will eventually be used to port aewm++/mini window managers to C#/Mono 

NOTE: The XEvent structure is set to an explicit size of 192 for a 64bit system. Edit
that if you are on a 32 bit system to be half the size. I'll try to automate this later.

The code is rough, not everything works or is totally correct yet. No documentation.
